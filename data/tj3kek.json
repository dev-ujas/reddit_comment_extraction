These are what I call the \"fun\" of calc 1. \n\nIntegrals are, well, integral to understanding a lot of math after Calc 1. Probability especially likes integrating over functions (which is probably the most common data science application of integrals) to find the probability of an event in a sample space. However, there are functions that are easy to integrate, and there are functions that will make you through your book at the wall trying to integrate, and it gets even worse in Calc 2 with trig subs and integration by parts. \n\nRealistically, if you wanted to understand what's actually happening with these three topics you could get the gist of it over a weekend: limits describe how the function behaves to that limit, derivatives describe the rate of change of a function, and integrals are the area under the curve of a function. That's super simplified, but you get the point. I don't have to know every car to be able to explain how an engine uses gas, spark, and air to turn a crankshaft. \n\nIf you want to be able to look at a function and apply all three learning objectives of calc 1, it'll probably take a few weeks, if you just want to understand what you can learn from a function (and you're driven to figure it out) I'd bet you could do it in around a week.",

Analysis concerns itself with the behavior of infinity and particularly infinite sequences.\n\nFor the Calculus concept of \"the Derivative\" of a function, used to give the slope of a tangent to a curve, we take a sequence of points which converge to the point we are calculating a derivative for, in this case x:\n\n    (f(x+h)-f(x))/h\n\nTaking a sequence of values for h which converges to 0 will give the slope of the tangent to the curve f() at x when h reaches infinity.\n\nFortunately, rather than waiting for infinity we can simplify the above equation in many cases. The classic example is f(x)=x^(2). In this case the above equation becomes:\n\n    ((x+h)^2 - x^2) / h =\n    (x^2 + 2hx + h^2 - x^2) / h =\n    (2hx +h^(2)) / h=\n    2x + h\n\nNow we can safely substitute 0 for h and get an answer without having to worry about an undefined arithmetic operation. The derivative of x^2 is in fact 2x.\n\nNow you theoretically know calculus. You can use this method to derive all the common computational results of calculus. Unless you are in a real-world engineering domain of some kind (computer vision counts, but I mean like building bridges mainly) you probably will only really need to work with polynomial expressions and not worry about trigonometry too much.\n\nDo you actually know calculus now? Eh. You definitely don't have the muscle memory developed by working problem sets or seeing example sets worked by the professor for 100 minutes per week for a year.\n\nAs an exercise, consider deriving the derivative using the above method for the following functions:\n\n    x^2 + 2\n    x^2 + x\n\nAnd watch more videos and instructionals. If you can get the derivative you get the important part for understanding Gradient Descent in ML (well, this and realizing that when a curve bottoms out there must be a spot where the derivative is 0, same goes for when a curve tops out though). Integrals are important for understanding statistics at a higher level. The area under a curve (the integral) is used to define probabilities from a curved probability density function, like the Bell Curve. That said, this is kinda high-level and I have not had to use understanding of integrals the way I have frequently used derivatives in optimization problems of various kinds.",

When I was in high school, I was in a program at a college where I was able to get high school credit for taking college classes.  It was significantly easier than where I eventually went to undergrad, and I took 6-7 classes per term, which I had to get special permission to do because it was unheard of for anybody in the school to do that much.  And that was only half of what you claimed to be taking.  Assuming your claims are true, which I highly doubt, you would have to be the best student at the shittiest school I have ever heard of.  A school that is easier than most high schools.  Which is not adequately preparing its students for anything.  What you are describing is so foreign to my experiences that I literally cannot believe it.\n\nBut still, I didn't downvote.",
