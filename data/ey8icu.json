And thats what I meant by commoditizing 95% of use cases.\n\nLet me correct you, a typical ML model will never be able to tell why and how, because that is achieved by causal modeling experiments done through randomized controlled trials. That is the proper way. Throwing linear reg or xgboost and trying to explain coefficients is the first rookie mistake and it just tells how few people actually understand statistics.\n\nAnother thing is that ML applicability is limited, sometimes you just need to empower end user and let them use data to creatively discover everything. and that is infinetely broader use case than ML."
