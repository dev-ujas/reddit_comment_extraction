Degrees matter less and less in tech, they really only show that you can dedicate time and effort to learn something, but well roundedness versus being an educated expert in one area goes a lot further. \n\nI have Analytics, Data Privacy, information Security, Business Systems Engineering, and data management experience and got tossed offers left and right for managing data science programs, governance programs, privacy programs, and Analytics programs.

I was already tech-oriented and knew the basics of programming but really only the bare minimum. I started researching how to automate stuff I didn't like to do at my job (a lot of which involved research and data gathering from websites like LinkedIn) - the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python was invaluable here.\n\nThis freed up a lot of my time to 1. study and 2. apply those studies at my role, which allowed me to spend more and more of my time building data pipelines to scale up what we were doing and analyze the data with more rigor. I asked leadership at the company if I could focus on that full-time and they said sure, because I had already made the entire process much richer and faster than it was when I joined on.\n\nI then found out about a program from a company called Correlation One in partnership with Softbank called DS4A Latam, which was aimed at people already familiar with Python, statistics and already in data roles, so I wasn't too hopeful of getting in as it was very competitive, but I did.\n\nThe program helped me put a name to a lot of the concepts I had already picked up by necessity at my role, but I realized I was doing a lot of stuff wrong - I had basically coded up my own shit version of Pandas using lists of dicts because I didn't know how it worked, for example. It also got me started with machine learning and working in practical projects in an industry context.\n\nIt was obviously not the be-all-end-all of data science knowledge I needed or will ever need, but it helped me get to a point where I was comfortable enough with the topics to study by myself and pick up new skills quickly.\n\nI quit my job at the other company at the tail end of the program to focus on my studies and job search, not expecting to find anything for a few months, but I was contacted by a recruiter from my current company (a fairly large hospitality startup in LATAM) right after it ended. I joined on as a Jr. Data Scientist and was promoted to DS and then DS Manager fairly quickly. The data team at my company is fairly big in proportion to the others, but we're obviously not doing FAANG-level research DS, mostly a lot of pipelines, automations, dashboards, analyses to answer specific questions and the occasional model or algorithm to solve a particularly thorny problem, most notably for pricing.\n\nI generally agree with the advice given in the main post. In my experience, both as an IC and manager, it's way more important to be able to understand what people need in practical terms and translate that into technical action than to be amazing at ML theory and advanced statistics which very rarely come up outside of fairly specialized roles and workloads. (This is where confusion around what DS means as a title also comes in, so it's important to know what you actually want to do and find a company that's aligned with that).",

I was already tech-oriented and knew the basics of programming but really only the bare minimum. I started researching how to automate stuff I didn't like to do at my job (a lot of which involved research and data gathering from websites like LinkedIn) - the book Automate the Boring Stuff with Python was invaluable here.\n\nThis freed up a lot of my time to 1. study and 2. apply those studies at my role, which allowed me to spend more and more of my time building data pipelines to scale up what we were doing and analyze the data with more rigor. I asked leadership at the company if I could focus on that full-time and they said sure, because I had already made the entire process much richer and faster than it was when I joined on.\n\nI then found out about a program from a company called Correlation One in partnership with Softbank called DS4A Latam, which was aimed at people already familiar with Python, statistics and already in data roles, so I wasn't too hopeful of getting in as it was very competitive, but I did.\n\nThe program helped me put a name to a lot of the concepts I had already picked up by necessity at my role, but I realized I was doing a lot of stuff wrong - I had basically coded up my own shit version of Pandas using lists of dicts because I didn't know how it worked, for example. It also got me started with machine learning and working in practical projects in an industry context.\n\nIt was obviously not the be-all-end-all of data science knowledge I needed or will ever need, but it helped me get to a point where I was comfortable enough with the topics to study by myself and pick up new skills quickly.\n\nI quit my job at the other company at the tail end of the program to focus on my studies and job search, not expecting to find anything for a few months, but I was contacted by a recruiter from my current company (a fairly large hospitality startup in LATAM) right after it ended. I joined on as a Jr. Data Scientist and was promoted to DS and then DS Manager fairly quickly. The data team at my company is fairly big in proportion to the others, but we're obviously not doing FAANG-level research DS, mostly a lot of pipelines, automations, dashboards, analyses to answer specific questions and the occasional model or algorithm to solve a particularly thorny problem, most notably for pricing.\n\nI generally agree with the advice given in the main post. In my experience, both as an IC and manager, it's way more important to be able to understand what people need in practical terms and translate that into technical action than to be amazing at ML theory and advanced statistics which very rarely come up outside of fairly specialized roles and workloads. (This is where confusion around what DS means as a title also comes in, so it's important to know what you actually want to do and find a company that's aligned with that)."

Meanwhile the US only grants about 80K student visas per year.\n\nAs for stricter qualifications for international students? Please. That b.s. was already been debunked by researchers already. [https://vancouversun.com/news/politics/foreign-students-at-ubc-squeezing-out-domestic-applicants-profs-paper-argues](https://vancouversun.com/news/politics/foreign-students-at-ubc-squeezing-out-domestic-applicants-profs-paper-argues). It's a fact that they're cash cows for schools because they pay more tuition, and as such get lower standards. You don't magically find over 40% more qualified international students while conveniently deciding that domestic applicants are simultaneously not qualified.  \n\nLet's not even get into the fact that Canadian banks like RBC have literally been replacing their Canadian workers with foreigners for years under the bogus guise that they can't find qualified Canadians. [https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/rbc-scrambles-to-explain-hiring-practices-to-canadians-after-contentious-report-1.1227904](https://winnipeg.ctvnews.ca/rbc-scrambles-to-explain-hiring-practices-to-canadians-after-contentious-report-1.1227904). Must be super essential to know Mandarin in a country where the official languages of business are English and French, right? \n\nDid RBC issue a public apology for something they didn't do? https://globalnews.ca/news/472919/rbc-makes-public-apology-for-outsourcing/\n\nIf you're looking at the top 7 schools in Canada, sorry there is literally no difference between a rigorous undergrad program and a non-thesis masters program that forms the glut of international admissions. \n\nWhy would you admit that your team is underpaid compared to their American counterparts? A manager level position with a graduate degree \"requirement\" in STEM earning $100K? That's a STEM undergrad starting salary in the US, buddy. $100K is literally what a facility manager (i.e. janitor supervisor) makes even at a very mediocre school like Ryerson. That's a position with zero post-secondary education, let alone a STEM graduate degree.\n\nThere's a reason UWaterloo undergrads head for the US as soon as they graduate, and it isn't because Canada pays them well, especially not in relation to the cost of living.
