By this I mean that you cannot programmatically clean data to solve DQ issues. This is because it treats the symptom and not the underlying root cause. All DQ issues are a result of non-adherence to processes, by either people or systems. For example - people may be dishonest to improve their stats, or may make errors unintentionally such as typos, or systems may be setup to have text fields holding dates, etc etc. Unless the root cause is identified and resolved, you are merely treating a symptom rather than curing the disease. \n\nI'll happily take the argument that you might need both, especially due to budgetary constraints or pragmatism. But - engagement with a business about the quality of their data, and increasing their maturity rather than giving them plasters, will ultimately enable data science and analytics far further in the long run.

Something that requires more training time and is more complex may take a few days. That pales in comparison to the time it takes to - define the business problem, define the analytical problem, wrangle the data, work with SMEs to understand the data, interpret outputs of your algorithm, figure out how to deliver those insights to the business. \n\nUsually I tell my 'green' data scientists that you'll spend 30% of your time framing up the problem, 30% collecting and cleaning data, 10% modeling, 30% figuring out how to use the model outputs IRL.
