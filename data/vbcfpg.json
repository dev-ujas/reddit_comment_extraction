I had to follow up with the interior designers and the builder about the completion of the work. That's the work of the Administration department, isn't it? I'd often remark to my supportive colleagues that I just didn't paint the place; I seem to have done everything else. The company treated me like a jackass.\n\nThe main problem was that they never acknowledged my introversion, English fluency, voracious reading habit, grammatical perfection and my writing ability. I tried my best to articulate to everyone around, but they were far more content in undermining me. The icing on the cake: I was also used for creating calendar invites and hosting Zoom meetings. Exactly what executive assistants should be doing. The irony was that we had a receptionist, but I was still the one doing it.\n\nThat was the last straw for me. I had joined in February 2020 and had wanted to leave in July 2020, but the pandemic-induced slowdown meant that there were no jobs available in the market (in India, at least). Besides, I was looking for an opportunity as a content writer rather than as a data science professional (yeah, I finally decided to go mainstream with my passion).\n\nAfter a year and a half of job hunting, I finally landed one and I happily resigned from Star in January 2022. People at Star were baffled; some of them still call me for clarifications on the LMS and I angrily respond that \"I resigned from your shithole company long back. Stop calling me.\" Some of them still assume that I would be at Star forever. The fact that Star Health has people who spend their entire career at one company is a bummer. This \"taken-for-granted\" attitude is what irked me the most.\n\nThankfully, my current company [https://examroom.ai/](https://examroom.ai/) is heaven. I'm ready to go over and above for them as they differ from my previous employer in critical aspect: they accept me for who I am. They embrace my introversion. They provide flexible timings, which is a boon for writers like me. My advice to you is this: work at a place where you are respected. It's sad that I am getting this respect only at the age of 29, 7 years after I entered the workforce, but I'm thankful that I'm at least getting it now."

They both got the jobs because of family connections to upper management, but both severely hindered and harmed the work and productivity of the actual software folks.
