I had a coworker who was giving a lot of thought on how to encode an ordinal scale variable because 'the distance between the values isn't consistent'.  I asked if she was doing prediction or inference, to which she replied 'just prediction'.  I told her she can start with simply converting the field from 'character' to 'numeric' (this was R) and she flat out refused.  Why?  Because her background told her that it's inappropriate to code a feature in a way that doesn't accurately represent it.  My background told me that if you're interested in simply getting better predictions then it doesn't matter if the variable isn't actually interval.\n\nThe above meme is mainly a knee jerk reaction to snotty neophytes who 'work in ML' and deride stats.",

Traditional statisticians are much more concerned with interpretability.\n\nIn addition you're mixing computer science, numerical methods and statistics to do ML so it's a sort of fusion. Almost every discipline is a fusion anymore. Statisticians need linear algebra, physicists need to use statistics, etc.\n\nThat being said, a PhD mathematician, statistician, physicist, computer scientist, etc. can all learn how to do ML. You don't need a degree in it, you just need to know your math and have some practical computing experience for your domain. ML is using existing math that is used all over the place in a creative way, that is all.\n\nEvery scientist should learn how to code anymore. It's necessary for work and otherwise is simply a good idea. Computers are incredibly useful laboratories.\n\nAs far as finding work as a statistician vs. a ML scientist, the real problem is that the people making strategic and hiring decisions don't know what the hell they're doing.

Neural networks come from psychology & AI side of computer science and aren't really used in statistics. Similarly there are plenty of algorithmic methods that are uninterpretable that statisticians don't use but engineers and economists happily use in the industry because they mostly care that it works, not why it works.\n\nIf you think about it, everything about computers is just some switches going on and off.

The first program, the \"student\", works by using some input data set and some best guesses for what decisions to make, does some operation in a fuzzy way and stops when it thinks it's done or is forced to stop. The second program, the \"teacher\", grades the performance of the first program, and aggregates the results into guesses that are slightly better. (This is just for explanation. This may be one actual program, or it may be two or three or more small programs.)\n\nNow, you run student program 1,000 times, and then feed the results into the teacher, which returns a set of better guesses. Now you take those better guesses, and run the student 1,000 times again, which the teacher grades into *even better* guesses. The whole idea is to construct a virtuous cycle of improvement. As long as your input data set is consistent and your evaluation of the performance is correct, then your guesses will steadily improve over time.\n\nIt's basically the computer program version of the [dropped stick method to estimate pi](https://www.sciencefriday.com/articles/estimate-pi-by-dropping-sticks/). The thing is, if you can make dropping sticks easier and faster to do than [a continuous fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Continued_fractions), then suddenly dropping sticks is a great idea! For certain very complex problems, it's difficult to understand all the factors at work to derive an accurate heuristic. If it's easier to write a program to *guess* at how to do something as well as write another program that grades and aggregates that performance into better guesses.
