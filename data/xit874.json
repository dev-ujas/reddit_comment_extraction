It was a background assumption of my response that, like, \"the most effective workout is one you'll actually do.\" For me, planning things so specifically keeps me motivated. I don't know if it's ultimately more effective to do anything one way or the other; there are things like \"Joker sets\" in the 5/3/1 program that are ways of making up for the situation you find yourself in not going according to plan, i.e. you do extra sets if you seem to be lifting a lot more than you planned, i.e. there are plans that improvise and adapt themselves to the situation at hand more than the plan you put down on paper.",

You can get a frequency representation of the data, but if you try to make the assumption that a dft is continuous and use it to represent future data it often wont hold up in the real world.\n\nIts representing the whole signal as a periodic function, which is cool and useful, but what i need is to find which parts of a signal are periodic and which parts can be, but should not be; represented with a periodic function.\n\nFor example, look at the graph of x+sin(x).  It can be approximated with dft, however that representation is flawed because it will be representing it as a sum of multiple periodic functions.  But as the ones who designed the basis function we know that is not the case.\n\nSo what i really want to know is if there is a way to test the validity of fourier components, or otherwise detect the presence of non periodic components mixed with periodic ones.",
