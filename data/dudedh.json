Can you create a service that generates strings that sound like potential pokemon names? And what might be the simplest possible way to make that into a service? Also, would it be possible to generate pokemon names that start with three random characters and end with 'base' (KREBASE, MONBASE would be appropriate but IEYBASE would not be).\n\n>Turns out that this is an interesting problem from a ML standpoint and that it is rediculously easy to build in the cloud. In my talk I will explain the ML behind it;\n\n>markov chains\n>probibalistic graphs\n>rnn/lstm\n>bidirectional lstm\n\n\n**Notes**\n\nGreat talk and also interesting from an implementation standpoint (AWS lambda)."
