I'm not proposing that, just illustrating that the data is relative to a process and the more we understand and are able control that process, the more we can manipulate what the data will look like (hopefully a nice no slope line around 0 cases eventually).\n\nTake newtonian mechanics. If I throw a ball in the air I have great well tested models that will predict its behaviors. Because I know all that information so well, I can introduce another ball and using the same model, make the balls intersect in the air in a way the primary ball has now skewed from it's natural progression that the initial model projected. A new holistic model now needs to account for the intervention of the balls. They may still use the same underlying mechanics but their interactions can result in behaviors you weren't initially accounting for because there was no sort of intervention before.\n\nExponential growth is not an absolute requirement.",

I'm not proposing that, just illustrating that the data is relative to a process and the more we understand and are able control that process, the more we can manipulate what the data will look like (hopefully a nice no slope line around 0 cases eventually).\n\nTake newtonian mechanics. If I throw a ball in the air I have great well tested models that will predict its behaviors. Because I know all that information so well, I can introduce another ball and using the same model, make the balls intersect in the air in a way the primary ball has now skewed from it's natural progression that the initial model projected. A new holistic model now needs to account for the intervention of the balls.
