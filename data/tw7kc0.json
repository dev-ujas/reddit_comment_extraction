But there's a fine line between showing interest and being too pushy, so tread carefully. \n\nBasically, sniping the best opportunities always worked well for me. Hiring managers have a good intuition for cookie cutter applications and will be triggered by an application that stands out from the rest.

Then, I went to work for another real backwater e-commerce company as their sole developer, I did SQL, VBA macros and Magento 2 support (website development). \n\nThen, I worked as a freelancer for a bit, did a few gigs on Upwork, made fuck all money doing it, but did a few Azure database migrations, got lots of exposure to power bi, made a few dashboards. Then I got picked up by a start-up consultancy, consultancy was basically what made my career, worked for some huge names, and learned python proper etc. All started in backwater companies though, real small, local businesses that just wanted someone nearby who could \"use the computers\". I think my first official job title was \"computer operator\"."
