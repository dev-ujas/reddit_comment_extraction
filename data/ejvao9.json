After all, it's their work and business I'm analyzing. \n\nI engineer variables more appropriately after these conversations. My dashboards are more used after these conversations. My models generally yield better metrics after these conversations. My work is more appreciated. \n\nDS folks dig into the technical programming and mathematics because we have been cultured to via the internet. DS professional development was born of the internet. So the discourse lends itself to topics more aligned with internet culture. Interpersonal skills are not emphasized here. But from what I've experienced, those are the skills you need to get your work accepted and to learn about your domain. That generally happens in an actual job as it is very difficult to simulate in a class."

That includes backing projects you think are not going in a great direction. One thing I realized is that projects that have a bad direction sometimes sink and projects with a bad direction and no support always sink. If you are put in a bad direction, you should still support the project as best as possible. If it sinks, you can tell them, that they should have listened. If it doesn't, you will have a SME that trusts you to work WITH them instead of trying to force their hand on THEIR project.\n\nEdit:\n\nThe difference between someone successful in DS and someone not is usually a pretty even combination of:\n\n1) how they work with the people around them.\n\n2) how much they know"

I am in no way an expert but I have been very successful in my role. I am the first Data Scientist at my company and we have had 4 others added in the last year due to me being run thin and the demand on my time increasing. I work in the finance industry so we have a lot of data (I would say 1000 tables is a VERY conservative estimate). I think this is is all pretty unique and there are still a lot of things that I am learning so take what I say with a grain of salt.\n\n>So its less about science and more about connections and building trust?\n\nThat has been my experience. The most successful project I was on made a \\~50% reduction in turnaround time across all process in the company. I stumbled on the problem because of a logistic model I ran. When started diving into the issue, a SME said 'this is so beautiful I want to vomit' because of how much money/effort/etc was wasted. I then spent 3 months trying to better understand the data surrounding the processes, issues that cropped up, and other things we could take action on. To help implement the change, the SME that started the project with me worked probably 60+ hours a week and got promoted to better lead it. The change resulted in less man hour cost, higher win rate for new clients, and around $3m a year in client retention because of the faster turn around times. I didnt know for 2 years but the SME had put really everything into this change. I knew he worked a lot but I didnt know he pushed for this to be his only project (he would live or die by it) and actually changed the culture of those employees impacted by the change to see it's success. He made fun instructional videos, he made screen savers on computers, he did everything. He did this to see it's success because he believed in it in the project and the direction I gave.\n\nI am extremely confident that I could never implement the project as well as he did (and possibly not even well enough to see 1/4 of the gains we currently have) and am very grateful to have been able to work with him, as I am sure he is grateful to work with me...\n\n>What if the management is not ready to take the blame?\n\nWhat do you mean? In my world, projects are known as failed or successful. Someone is blamed and unless I gave poor direction (I should be blamed), it is often the project lead for their inability to take action. They are in charge of finding a good direction, pushing the change out, and getting people energized about the change. We are a tool they can use to find a direction, continuously track it's success (so they can stop a complete failure), or do experiments to see how best to push the change... but in the end of the day, we are just a single tool in their tool kit. \n\nTo sort of curb the likelihood of having giving poor direction, I think that it is beneficial for people new in their role to work extra hours to make sure that their projects don't fail and show they can be trusted on future work.\n\n>What else can we do to tackle the sink?\n\nI dont know if it is our responsibility. Your role is to provide as much guidance as possible. I think that the project leads are there to do everything they can to see the project succeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a final note, Charles Schwab was at one point hired to work in the steel industry. He was given a salary of $1m a year and it was considered the highest salary ever at the time. He was asked if he deserved it and he said he was paid this salary largely because of his ability to deal with people and was asked how he did it\n\n>\"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people, the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement. There is nothing else that so kills the ambitions of a person as criticisms from superiors. I never criticize anyone. I believe in giving a person incentive to work. So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.\"\n\nSo in the end, if you want to have projects succeed, you need to learn how to create enthusiasm and support of those you work with while still providing as much direction as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont know... is this helpful?",

The most successful project I was on made a \\~50% reduction in turnaround time across all process in the company. I stumbled on the problem because of a logistic model I ran. When started diving into the issue, a SME said 'this is so beautiful I want to vomit' because of how much money/effort/etc was wasted. I then spent 3 months trying to better understand the data surrounding the processes, issues that cropped up, and other things we could take action on. To help implement the change, the SME that started the project with me worked probably 60+ hours a week and got promoted to better lead it. The change resulted in less man hour cost, higher win rate for new clients, and around $3m a year in client retention because of the faster turn around times. I didnt know for 2 years but the SME had put really everything into this change. I knew he worked a lot but I didnt know he pushed for this to be his only project (he would live or die by it) and actually changed the culture of those employees impacted by the change to see it's success. He made fun instructional videos, he made screen savers on computers, he did everything. He did this to see it's success because he believed in it in the project and the direction I gave.\n\nI am extremely confident that I could never implement the project as well as he did (and possibly not even well enough to see 1/4 of the gains we currently have) and am very grateful to have been able to work with him, as I am sure he is grateful to work with me...\n\n>What if the management is not ready to take the blame?\n\nWhat do you mean? In my world, projects are known as failed or successful. Someone is blamed and unless I gave poor direction (I should be blamed), it is often the project lead for their inability to take action. They are in charge of finding a good direction, pushing the change out, and getting people energized about the change. We are a tool they can use to find a direction, continuously track it's success (so they can stop a complete failure), or do experiments to see how best to push the change... but in the end of the day, we are just a single tool in their tool kit. \n\nTo sort of curb the likelihood of having giving poor direction, I think that it is beneficial for people new in their role to work extra hours to make sure that their projects don't fail and show they can be trusted on future work.\n\n>What else can we do to tackle the sink?\n\nI dont know if it is our responsibility. Your role is to provide as much guidance as possible. I think that the project leads are there to do everything they can to see the project succeed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs a final note, Charles Schwab was at one point hired to work in the steel industry. He was given a salary of $1m a year and it was considered the highest salary ever at the time. He was asked if he deserved it and he said he was paid this salary largely because of his ability to deal with people and was asked how he did it\n\n>\"I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people, the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.

So I am anxious to praise but loath to find fault. If I like anything, I am hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.\"\n\nSo in the end, if you want to have projects succeed, you need to learn how to create enthusiasm and support of those you work with while still providing as much direction as possible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dont know... is this helpful?"

Well discovered.\n\nOf course you understood by the context of the discussion that by 'useless' we meant 'has no applications.' At the end of the chain of work people do, building on the work of others, it's still the case that most of that doesn't become applied. This isn't an insult. This isn't making a case against doing science. It's just ... the case.\n\nMoreover, most of that work that you built your work off of came out of the top-tier institutions. But there are a loooooot more PhD granting institutions whose theses never get published anywhere and no one builds off of them.",
