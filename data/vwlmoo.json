Facebook and others have pushed the idea of separating the underlying storage system from the interface for analysts. Heck they helped create tools like Presto and Trino to query federated data sources, where analysts can focus on writing ANSI-compliant SQL and data engineers / infrastructure team can focus on doing w/e it takes to make data available in the system that makes sense.\n\nIt's also worth noting that there are two approaches to data at many companies:\n\n\\- Data Science\n\n\\- Analytics\n\nData science often is either its own team, or lives under Product or sometimes Engineering. DS uses Python, Julia, SQL, Scala / Spark, and more to focus more on modeling. Of course there are still plenty of R / Matlab folks writing core algorithms and these are usually former academics or phd students.\n\nAnalytics tends to live in SQL. dbt is a popular tool here as well to help you express data transformation / ELT logic as connected SQL queries ([http://dbt.com/](http://dbt.com/)). There's even a new profession called Analytics Engineer that focuses on using SQL to describe business logic.\n\nBusinesses, nonprofits, etc need WAY more people in **Analytics** than they do in DS. Analytics is about counting all of the important things reliably. This is INSANELY hard even though it shouldn't feel that way. \n\nData Science is often more about driving Product stuff. Like recommendations at Netflix and Spotify. Or identifying faces in images at Meta. Cool DS stuff gets 90% of the headlines but ironically 90% of the jobs (including very high paying ones) are more in \"Analytics\" than DS.\n\nAnyway I detect that I'm going off on a long rant here now so I will stop / pause!",
