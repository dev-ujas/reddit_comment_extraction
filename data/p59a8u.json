Deep learning, linear models, and some clustering approaches depend on optimization, landing it in the field of numerical optimization or operational research (or the thousand variants thereof). That is, you justify the effectiveness of optimization-based approaches via arguments about convexity or global optimal, not based on statistics. For example, gradient descent and Newtonian methods are based on calculus. While SGD and variance-reduction techniques do require statistical tools, the end goal is reducing the convergence rate in the convex case, leading to these techniques landing squarely in optimization with some real analysis or calculus (take your pick). While statistical arguments are sometimes used in machine learning theory, especially as it relates to average case analysis or making stronger results by applying assumptions of data (eg. that it emerges from a Gaussian process), there are a lot of results that don't come from the statistical domain. For example, many optimization approaches use linear algebra (eg. PCA and linear regression use the QR matrix decomposition for the asymptotically fastest SVD).\n\nStatistical learning theory is a foundational approach to understanding bounds and the effects of ML, but computational learning theory (CLT, sometimes referred to as machine learning theory) approaches machine learning from a multifaceted approach. For example, VC dimension and epsilon nets. You could argue that the calculations necessary for this are reminiscent of probability, but it's equally valid to use combinatorial arguments, especially since they sit close to set theory.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that statistics are sometimes a tool, sometimes analysis, but it *isn't* the end-all be-all of machine learning. Machine learning, like every field that came before it, depends on insights from other fields, until it became enough to be a field in its own right. Statistics depends on probability, set theory, combinatorics, optimization, calculus, linear algebra, and so forth, just as much as machine learning.

However, concerns have emerged regarding the exploitation of these contributions by technology barons, leading to a wide range of ethical and moral dilemmas [2]. This article aims to shed light on the exploitation of community contributions by technology barons, exploring issues such as intellectual property rights, open-source exploitation, unfair compensation practices, and the erosion of collaborative spirit [3].\n\n\n1. Intellectual Property Rights and Patents:\n\nOne of the fundamental ways in which technology barons exploit the contributions of the community is through the manipulation of intellectual property rights and patents [4]. While patents are designed to protect inventions and reward inventors, they are increasingly being used to stifle competition and monopolize the market [5]. Technology barons often strategically acquire patents and employ aggressive litigation strategies to suppress innovation and extract royalties from smaller players [6]. This exploitation not only discourages inventors but also hinders technological progress and limits the overall benefit to society [7].\n\n\n2. Open-Source Exploitation:\n\nOpen-source software and collaborative platforms have revolutionized the way technology is developed and shared [8]. However, technology barons have been known to exploit the goodwill of the open-source community. By leveraging open-source projects, these entities often incorporate community-developed solutions into their proprietary products without adequately compensating or acknowledging the original creators [9]. This exploitation undermines the spirit of collaboration and discourages community involvement, ultimately harming the very ecosystem that fosters innovation [10].\n\n\n3. Unfair Compensation Practices:\n\nThe contributions of engineers, scientists, and technologists are often undervalued and inadequately compensated by technology barons [11]. Despite the pivotal role played by these professionals in driving technological advancements, they are frequently subjected to long working hours, unrealistic deadlines, and inadequate remuneration [12]. Additionally, the rise of gig economy models has further exacerbated this issue, as independent contractors and freelancers are often left without benefits, job security, or fair compensation for their expertise [13]. Such exploitative practices not only demoralize the community but also hinder the long-term sustainability of the technology industry [14].\n\n\n4. Exploitative Data Harvesting:\n\nData has become the lifeblood of the digital age, and technology barons have amassed colossal amounts of user data through their platforms and services [15]. This data is often used to fuel targeted advertising, algorithmic optimizations, and predictive analytics, all of which generate significant profits [16]. However, the collection and utilization of user data are often done without adequate consent, transparency, or fair compensation to the individuals who generate this valuable resource [17]. The community's contributions in the form of personal data are exploited for financial gain, raising serious concerns about privacy, consent, and equitable distribution of benefits [18].\n\n\n5. Erosion of Collaborative Spirit:\n\nThe tech industry has thrived on the collaborative spirit of engineers, scientists, and technologists working together to solve complex problems [19]. However, the actions of technology barons have eroded this spirit over time. Through aggressive acquisition strategies and anti-competitive practices, these entities create an environment that discourages collaboration and fosters a winner-takes-all mentality [20]. This not only stifles innovation but also prevents the community from collectively addressing the pressing challenges of our time, such as climate change, healthcare, and social equity [21].\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe exploitation of the community's contributions by technology barons poses significant ethical and moral challenges in the realm of technology and innovation [22]. To foster a more equitable and sustainable ecosystem, it is crucial for technology barons to recognize and rectify these exploitative practices [23]. This can be achieved through transparent intellectual property frameworks, fair compensation models, responsible data handling practices, and a renewed commitment to collaboration [24]. By addressing these issues, we can create a technology landscape that not only thrives on innovation but also upholds the values of fairness, inclusivity, and respect for the contributions of the community [25].\n\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Smith, J.
