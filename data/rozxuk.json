Try not to take it as a personal attack though. There are definitely high level managers who couldn't differentiate a clustering algorithm from a hole in the ground. There are also smart ones, who *could* understand and articulate the nuances of different statistical methods if they needed to.\n\nI'm actually saving the image OP posted to show our CTO. Not to rib him and tease him about \"not getting it\" (he's smart and has a math background; totally could if he needed to). But to help give a \"whole iceberg\" view of the process and help him set the right expectations as we embark on a handful of \"AI\" projects.\n\n**tldr:** Some managers suck.

This post going for a false dichotomy to try to feed the prejudice is a good example of the culture.\n\nI don't think the beautiful field of data science benefits from feeding the narrative of them-and-us, and most people don't like to work with people whose default mode is to look down upon them. \n\nAnd yes, I get that many management teams are a pain, technology is misunderstood and overrated. There's push for solutions, where the problem isn't understood well. And yes, people can know just enough to screw things up. \n\nBut hey, can't we just all get along?"
