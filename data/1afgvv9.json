Quality of life DOES come from balance: personal talents, EQ and emotional management, opportunities taken or passed over, health, community identity, and a sense of relevance with self-determination, along with the vagaries of luck.  I absolutely agree that corporate America focuses on profits (often unreasonable) at any cost, and this focus on ever-growing profits can hit workers hard on all personal and work-related levels.  This impact has destroyed many dedicated people who have committed their lives to the success (profit growth) of the corporation they work for. This is where we agree, and we both might suggest an introduction of the word \u2018enough\u2019 (what IS enough) to create a conversation about synergistic corporate paradigm change.  Where we do not agree has to do with giving up one\u2019s personal commitment to excellence (going beyond what is expected), a character trait.  This commitment shows up in relationships, one\u2019s own lifestyle - virtually in all one does.  The issue here may have more to do with disappointed expectations than with corporate commitment to the well-being of workers.  The environments of workers in corporations are crafted to create unquestioned commitment to the production of profit.  Team-building, perks, acknowledgments, impressive titles, and other methods ARE seductive and effective at creating a FEELING of being part of a work \u2018family\u2019 with shared objectives.  However, commitment to family and commitment to Corporate America are different and result in different outcomes when expectations are not met. Corporations expect growing profit, family expects continued relatedness.  It is important not to conflate the two.  Excellence as a character trait will pick us up after we recover from a fall because it is essentially about self determination, and self-determination is important for our well-being.",

            "ans": "Part of your point makes sense to me, but your assumptions and examples betray the logic and weaken your argument IMO. I agree that sweeping layoffs without consideration of how the strong team members could carry on is short sighted. However,\n\nAssumptions:  it is a corporate officer\u2019s job to steer the ship and make tough decisions of strategy. If the company has to change directions to stay legitimate in the market, then that includes making big decisions about choosing among products and services that have best promise. These are tough calls. There will be error, but making those decisions is how a free market works (and should), although I feel empathy for the lost jobs because it can be a very difficult struggle from which to recover. Been there. \n\nExamples: a car isn\u2019t going to fall apart without hubcaps, spare tires, and air caps. These things are by definition cosmetic or convenient, and the market is stating these things are not required.  If by the same token, the products/services/features being developed by the tech team are irrelevant, then the market is choosing not to pay for them. \n\nThe signal then IMO is for data scientists and similar tech professions (I\u2019m a DS/manager/product owner) is to take it upon themselves to embrace the uncomfortable challenge of determining what is important and why, and strive to be at the center of the target of your organization\u2019s value proposition (not at the periphery, and you have to learn to tell the difference).  It is not good enough to know some methods, apply them and shit out some numbers then walk away (how I see many ppl approach their roles).  \n\nYou have to use the lens of the world which has the yoke of the stress and uncertainty and risk that the corporate officers face, that there are no obvious answers and competitors are coming for you all the time. It\u2019s not enough to just show up and say \u201ctell me what to do\u201d. You have to take an active stance. In a free market, there is no real security beyond hustle, good critical thinking, consistent value creation, and a sense of ownership. \n\nOf note: I\u2019m not suggesting your corporate decisions were good or that you personally don\u2019t have this sense of ownership. However, the general tone of responses to this thread and others here is very one-sided w a step towards guaranteed employment AND high and increasing wages.",

Yes, it is harder these days in many ways. Understand the rules, follow the plan even when times are bleak.\n\nThe rule is:\n\nCreate positive cash flow\n\nAnother way of saying it is:\n\nSpend less than you earn\n\nThe optimal recommended sequence is generally:\n\nA) build a budget and save an emergency fund\n\n- this is generally recommended to be between 3-6 months of expenses. Historically it was generally 3 months but when times are tougher recommendations tend to be longer\n\nB) Pay off debt\n\n- start with the high interest debt first\n\n- there are situations where debt can be valuable. Holding debt backed by real estate, while renting out the real estate and earning cash flow is an example. \n\n- if you can earn more income than the interest rate on the debt, it makes sense to earn that income while carrying debt, but debt cuts both ways. It can build wealth especially when interest rates are low or dropping, but it is equally capable of destroying wealth especially when interest rates are high or rising. It's a double edged source. Caution is highly recommended\n\nC) Begin investing\n\n- this does not need to be complicated. In fact, it should be simple. If you do not understand an investment do not invest in it. \n\n- the recommended path for the average person is: do not buy individual stocks. Buy index funds. These funds contain a variety of stocks designed to mirror the returns of the market or a segment of the market. The reason for this strategy is that almost nobody, even the experts, ever actually beats the market. \n\n- study dollar cost averaging. It's time in the market that matters, not timing the market. The sooner you begin the sooner you will see results\n\n- Understand that the biggest pitfall is your own emotions. The average person panics in and sells in the dips. Buy indexes and hold them for the long term. Don't panic and sell in the dips and then buy back in after the recovery. Dips are a buying opportunity. When things go on sale KEEP BUYING\n\n- Look at the Couch Potatoe style of investing. It is very simple and boring. Saving and investing for retirement should be simple, and boring.\n\n- There is a fairly simple equation that defines at what point your investment returns should exceed your employment income. Study this equation. Benchmark and monitor your progress. Once you reach this point you have \"Fuck you\" money\n\njoin r/personalfinance or find a personal finance discussion group for your country\n\njoin r/FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) or find a FIRE discussion group for your country\n\ngood luck stranger",
