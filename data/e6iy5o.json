So:**\n\n**TL;DR: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell suggests that above a threshold, added intelligence doesn\u2019t correlate to success. He argues that oddball questions like \u201clist all of the possible uses of a large rock\u201d do a better job of finding applicants with the skills important for professional success than SAT style questions. I think your little test falls into this oddball category.**\n\nI recently read Outliers by Malcom Gladwell and he talks about how intelligence doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate to success. Above a certain point, having a higher IQ doesn\u2019t translate to higher probability of professional success. He cites many examples, most notably showing that \u201clesser quality\u201d applicants admitted to Ivy League law school due to affirmative action have the same probability of success after law school as \u201chigher quality\u201d applicants (ie. smarter, higher IQ, better test scores/gpa, etc). \n\nThere is also another famous study that I can\u2019t remember the name where a guy went searching for the smartest kids in elementary school. He then followed these geniuses and even helped them get into good schools are get opportunities not available to their \u201cdumber\u201d counterparts. He was convinced these kids would be the next Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, presidents and CEOs. The result? Nothing special. A few were above average success, a few below. No statistically significant findings - years later someone proved that he would have had the same level of \u201csuccessful\u201d people if he had selected kids at random. \n\nNow, this is obviously different as in an interview you aren\u2019t giving them an IQ test. But I think there is a connection between the standard interview questions and the relative \u201csmartness\u201d of the applicant. Standard coding questions aren\u2019t unlike IQ tests or the SATs. \n\nGladwell argues that questions like \u201cplease list out all possible uses of a large rock\u201d are a better indicator of the skills necessary for success, compared to more general SAT style questions. You get more insight into not only the way an applicants mind works, but also his imagination, whether he is funny, etc. \n\nSince knowledge and IQ becomes largely irrelevant after a certain level, rather than selecting the smartest applicant, we should really be using some other filtering mechanism. Gladwell makes a good case for how oddball questions may fit that need. \n\nI think your little test falls into this \u201coddball\u201d category, and therefore does more to test the capabilities of an applicant than does \u201cwrite a program that returns only prime numbers given a string of numbers\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m not really sure why I decided to go off on this tangent, but I personally really liked your tactic and found your thought process as to why it works to be very clever and interesting. I thought I\u2019d explain, albeit at a high level and without firm sources, why I think science and the statistics of success seem to backup your style of thinking.",
