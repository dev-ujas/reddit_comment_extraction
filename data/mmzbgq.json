Struggled to get a job because internship experience is not enough. \n\nJoined a small startup and did some software engineering and NLP. Company went under so I left as they couldn't pay salary. But got a better contract gig since I now had real experience. \n\nRinse and repeat. Job hunting again now but with 3+ years of US experience, mix of data science and data/software engineering. \n\nLot of struggle, a bit of luck, and mostly learnt on the job. It gets easier, for sure. You search the same stack overflow answers so your brain recognizes patterns. And then you have friends in different companies after a while so you get referrals for easy interviews, instead of automatic mail rejections.

But got a better contract gig since I now had real experience. \n\nRinse and repeat. Job hunting again now but with 3+ years of US experience, mix of data science and data/software engineering. \n\nLot of struggle, a bit of luck, and mostly learnt on the job. It gets easier, for sure. You search the same stack overflow answers so your brain recognizes patterns. And then you have friends in different companies after a while so you get referrals for easy interviews, instead of automatic mail rejections. It does get easier, got to hang in there ...\n\nOr be exceptional and have a wonderful GitHub profile with the latest technology experience, and a mentor who can guide you right. Being so motivated isn't easy, so fake it till you make it I would say."
