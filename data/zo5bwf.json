Rather they are more likely to identify with their chosen specialism as a feature engineer/data explorer, researcher/modelling, ML engineering, systems, MLOps, data engineer. So someone claiming to be good at data science without having developed a specialism is a red flag",

I also pointed out that I had experience in almost nothing listed under my technical skills section before starting the bootcamp.\n\nI got the job.\n\nThe kicker? The interview was for a good job at the same school I took the bootcamp, and I was already accepted and enrolled in their master's program as well.

That doesn't mean you ask everyone you meet for a job, but building up a network can mean you make your own marketing plan, make your skills known, and make yourself easy to find. There's a lot involved in building up a great career, and unfortunately, technical skills are not enough. I'm going to spend my next few years building connections with influential people.

Imagine this scenario, you build a data center lineup made up from several different types of servers, and we need to model the probability of the entire lineup drawing more power than the a specific value. You can always add information of the individual components, but they have none-trivial none-linear interactions by the mere fact that they are lumped together, the unique ID which is created for the lineup can encode some of that none-trivial none-linear interactions. Do note, that by my experience, I find that there is a limit to when it stops being helpful. I was asked to investigate whether the embedding approach was helpful when we had millions of customers, and that ended up not working. You sort of need a lot of examples by ID for this approach to work. \n\n\nAlso, recommender systems using matrix decomposition basically use unique IDs all the time to make predictions, as the embedding representation is basically the ids."
