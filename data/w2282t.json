They also service UT Austin among others, but my understanding is more that they provide the infrastructure to implement these bootcamps, and the schools select their own instructors.  I don't know about other schools, but Southern Methodist University likes to make sure their instructors have experience both with teaching and actually performing the work in the field.  Our instructor owns his own data science consulting firm that offers services to auto dealerships.  Another one does moneyball work for a baseball team.  One substitute performed work for communications between low-orbit satellites.  So the expertise offered is pretty good.\n\nThe bonus here is that upon completion, you may be eligible (pending good grades and approval) to use the bootcamp to skip the first two classes in their data science Master's degree program.\n\nAs for opportunities, I've been talking with management of a major holding firm here in Dallas, and they're going to have me do a sort of internship.  I'm looking to pad my resume, they're looking into convincing one of their subsidiaries to invest more in data science.\n\nWhatever your experience or education, you'll get out of it what you put into it.  My group and I put in some extremely late hours into our project.  In two weeks, we made a website that shows data we scraped from about 2,400 web pages in an attempt to expose [auto dealerships which gouge on prices](https://gouge-data.herokuapp.com/).  Another group created [this page](https://paranormactivities.herokuapp.com/), which just blew all of us away with how clean and complete the site looks.\n\nI still have a tremendous amount I need to learn on my own after class is over.  While I've taken calculus and statistics before, it's been about 10 years since I really practiced them, so I'll have to brush up on them.  I've got a stack of 11 books to get through, and no time to devote to any of them for now.  I've gone back and taken a couple college courses after I got my Bachelor's, but I never really got the chance to *apply* any of the skills I learned.  To me, that's been very frustrating, and I've ended up working at least 2 jobs a year for the past decade.  I'm done with it.  I'm tired of sweating in jeans and hoping the company I work for will expand enough for me to do more highly-skilled work.  I don't know how long I'll need to get the job I want, but I know the job is out there for me to find.\n\nI know that's a lot more than you were asking for, but I hope it helps.  When picking out a program, one thing you'll want to check is the reviews it gets (including places like CourseReport.com), and what kind of career services it offers.  A lot of the time, you get what you pay for.  I could have gone with a program that cost half as much, but it's the career support that really makes this program stand out locally.  Also, I think SMU may be the only one that offers a very real chance to earn college credit through their bootcamp.  It ends up being a slight discount on the whole program, bolstered by the fact that you're likely to get a better paying job before continuing the degree.\n\nI don't have all the answers, but I'm happy to share my experiences as I learn!",

They also service UT Austin among others, but my understanding is more that they provide the infrastructure to implement these bootcamps, and the schools select their own instructors.  I don't know about other schools, but Southern Methodist University likes to make sure their instructors have experience both with teaching and actually performing the work in the field.  Our instructor owns his own data science consulting firm that offers services to auto dealerships.  Another one does moneyball work for a baseball team.  One substitute performed work for communications between low-orbit satellites.  So the expertise offered is pretty good.\n\nThe bonus here is that upon completion, you may be eligible (pending good grades and approval) to use the bootcamp to skip the first two classes in their data science Master's degree program.\n\nAs for opportunities, I've been talking with management of a major holding firm here in Dallas, and they're going to have me do a sort of internship.  I'm looking to pad my resume, they're looking into convincing one of their subsidiaries to invest more in data science.\n\nWhatever your experience or education, you'll get out of it what you put into it.  My group and I put in some extremely late hours into our project.  In two weeks, we made a website that shows data we scraped from about 2,400 web pages in an attempt to expose [auto dealerships which gouge on prices](https://gouge-data.herokuapp.com/).  Another group created [this page](https://paranormactivities.herokuapp.com/), which just blew all of us away with how clean and complete the site looks.\n\nI still have a tremendous amount I need to learn on my own after class is over.  While I've taken calculus and statistics before, it's been about 10 years since I really practiced them, so I'll have to brush up on them.  I've got a stack of 11 books to get through, and no time to devote to any of them for now.  I've gone back and taken a couple college courses after I got my Bachelor's, but I never really got the chance to *apply* any of the skills I learned.  To me, that's been very frustrating, and I've ended up working at least 2 jobs a year for the past decade.  I'm done with it.  I'm tired of sweating in jeans and hoping the company I work for will expand enough for me to do more highly-skilled work.  I don't know how long I'll need to get the job I want, but I know the job is out there for me to find.\n\nI know that's a lot more than you were asking for, but I hope it helps.  When picking out a program, one thing you'll want to check is the reviews it gets (including places like CourseReport.com), and what kind of career services it offers.  A lot of the time, you get what you pay for.  I could have gone with a program that cost half as much, but it's the career support that really makes this program stand out locally.  Also, I think SMU may be the only one that offers a very real chance to earn college credit through their bootcamp.  It ends up being a slight discount on the whole program, bolstered by the fact that you're likely to get a better paying job before continuing the degree.\n\nI don't have all the answers, but I'm happy to share my experiences as I learn!"
