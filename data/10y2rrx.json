But the framing of the original OP just about implies that the upper management\u2019s \u201cprior\u201d judgments are based on little more than their feelings and intuitions. Which isn\u2019t nothing but certainly should not cause them to feel in a position that the data scientist must have the burden of overcoming their authoritative priors position.\n\nIn this case, it seems fair to say that both parties should come to the table with an open mind with as little confirmation or \u201cpriors\u201d bias as possible\u2026"
