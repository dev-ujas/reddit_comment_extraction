            "ans": "This is something the industry is still working out, but if we're looking at holistic data solutions, a practicing Data Scientist *should* be good at analytics, software engineering, and domain expertise. They *should* be able to feasibly provide guidance on data management, storage, ETL, model building, pipeline building, model training, model production/lifetime cycles, hypothesis development/testing, and some applied business analysis (specific to the domain). They don't need to be experts in all of them by any means, and it's unrealistic to think that they would be an expert in all of those things. But a *Data Scientist* should be able to cast a pretty **wide net** and know the ins and outs of the critical elements: how to store it, transform it, clean it, analyze it, use it, maintain it,.\n\nIt's not to say that a Data Analyst **can't** do those things it's not like medicine and licensure prevents it, but data analysis is a much more narrow scope. I would not expect a data analyst to be mucking around in ETL or pipeline building nor participate in (most) data management discussions. I also wouldn't expect them to be experts in production model lifecycle management. If we're talking about classic statistical data analysts, I also would more heavily emphasize knowledge of things like regressions, chi\\^2, etc... core quant and qual analytics foundations - and to be fair, I would *not* expect them to know how to build, train, and run neural networks. Analysts aren't software engineers, so if they are doing a lot of ML or pipeline development, I would surmise that they are working outside of their scope - this could be that they are trying to break out of an analysts role, which is all well and good, but it could also be that their employer is taking advantage of them and is giving them work that is more wide spread than what they should be doing as an analyst. They should be focused on Data Analysis, not all of the other stuff in the pipeline.\n\nThis also means that data analysts are specialists of sorts. Back to my analogy, a physician *could* do a nurses job, but I can almost guarantee that they *wouldn't* do it as well as an experienced nurse would... and ignoring licensing (and nurse practitioners) a nurse *could learn to* do a physicians job, but that would be wildly inappropriate, that is asking a nurse to take on way more responsibility than they *should* be taking on and paying them a *fraction* of what they would be making as a primary care provider. I like the analogy because if an employer were asking their nurses to function this way, it would be 100% evident that they were taking advantage of them to work beyond their scope so that they didn't need to pay for appropriate salaried employees. It's not to say they *couldn't* do it, it's that they *shouldn't* do it (also it would be illegal lol).",
