You might even have a ready-built solution you made for another client. Even at a high charge-out rate, your actual time could be measures in the hundreds of dollars in some cases.\n\nNow as a data scientist and/or logical person, you would think that a manager would want to pay as little as possible to fix a problem. But you'd be wrong, because it reflects poorly on someone to have had to hire an external consultant to solve a problem that was fixable in an hour and cost $200. In order for them, as managers, do demonstrate the value of the project, it helps for it to have been expensive and complex.\n\nSo you, as a consultant, get to help them do their job well by continuing that narrative. And as long as the rate you charge lays somewhere below what it would cost them to ultimately just learn and do it themselves, everyone is happy.\n\nThis is a great thing to know both as a consultant and as a person who also engages consultants.

I actually have ideas for cool projects all the time (not like the one above, like actually well thought out), some in research, some in applications. Some of them I\u2019ll even go in-depth and write up documents outlining everything in more detail and almost never get around to doing them. I think there\u2019s probably a lot of people on here who do the same thing, and if I could somehow get a small team organized to like do these kind of like hobby projects I think it\u2019d be really cool. Plus we could split up the work and have somebody to be accountable to. I think I\u2019ll make a post about it tomorrow, and let me know if you\u2019re interested!",
