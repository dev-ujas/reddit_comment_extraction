What I need to know more about is how you think about and approach data problems, how you implement solutions and work with other departments, etc. The cover letter hopefully gives me some of that, and gives me something to ask about. \n\nMy experience is somewhat niche, but in my experience data skills + domain knowledge and/or non-technical experience that's relevant to what I need is way more important than \"has the right keywords on their resume\".\n\nI'm sure \"it's a numbers game\" works for some people, but yes, 100% there are orgs who are looking for something else and spending time on a few applications will be more useful.

Or, at least, only the shittiest of shitty companies are actually using that kind of filter (in which case, you should be happy to be dropped from consideration).\n\nThe real answer is laziness on both the HR and hiring manager sides. The HRIS admin never disabled the feature to optionally submit a cover letter and the hiring manager doesn't want to review two documents for the >100 applicants they received for a single open position. \n\nI've been on both sides of this -- hiring manager and candidate. And, I've reached the point that I'm so confident in cover letters being pointless that I never submit one. Obviously, I can't ever know if it's eliminated me, but I've always received a good enough callback rate to consider it as something which has never hindered my career prospects."

We're not \"in demand\".\n\nSo I upvoted u/tiesioginis comment for his first part of the comment, the latter part wasn't necessary, since it's like getting a tip on how to get a girl from Brad Pitt & he'll be like: \"I go to a club, I point to a girl, suggest her to come to me, and she comes\". Yeah but nah. \n\nDo that (\"DM on LinkedIn\"), but be PREPAPRED to go through screenings & \"40 interviews\", otherwise u'll cry about how u r the only person who SUCKS in this world (negative self-talks arises from setting up too high standards, way above our own value & skills).",
