I worked in hazardous waste.  The boomers thought the had done a great job reducing hazardous waste in our state.  Turns out all the heavy manufacturing had moved over seas.  You see before us millennials were arround all they saw was the top aggregate number.  \n\nWe wanted to give them a more accurate picture of the situationm So we made a stacked bar chart showing hazardous waste generation over time by site, with one or two very large heavy industrial sites in a bright color. \n\nBosses asked what's that bright one that stopped some time back. We said that's the big industrial site. The bosses then asked us what does it look like without  those old sites.  We said that is a great question we will make a new chart.  Turns out hazardous waste generation had been going up(if you took away large facilities that went over seas.) When they asked for the chart they never questioned it, but if we had tried to tell them that no amount of explanation would have convinced them that they had accomplished nothing over their careers.",
