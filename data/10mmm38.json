Also, people kinda just think \"why the fuck do you want to work here with this fancy sounding PhD?\".  Which sucks when you just need a job. \n\nOne of my good friends is a math PhD in academia on the financial side of things.  He kinda says the same thing, as he considered leaving academia because of academia stuff.  While he would have probably been looking at more financial jobs, my understanding of his PhD/math is it can be kind of difficult to transition from the theoretical proofs and research to application (or whatever you guys do.... he explains it to me and my eyes glaze over...).  That being said, his mastery of math makes me think it could be incredibly universal to the point it's just about picking a direction and spending some time focusing there (like you did) before trying to directly get into the industry.  An important thing, I've noticed, is a lot of the time people don't recognize the breadth of experience that comes with a PhD a lot of the time.  Like, knowing a bunch of about your dissertation topic is kinda a small part of everything else you are doing.  It's kinda frustrating, because I gained a ton of non-science specific skills that are pretty universal in application, but the focus is on the topic.  \n\nBasically, having a PhD is a blessing and a curse in terms of employment opportunities.  It also sucks with academia being so impacted, that the transition to industry can be funky with topics and skills.",

Funnily enough, it turns out I enjoy the software engineering side way more than the data science side, so I'm now a software engineer working on a large data platform.

Also, people kinda just think \"why the fuck do you want to work here with this fancy sounding PhD?\".  Which sucks when you just need a job. \n\nOne of my good friends is a math PhD in academia on the financial side of things.  He kinda says the same thing, as he considered leaving academia because of academia stuff.  While he would have probably been looking at more financial jobs, my understanding of his PhD/math is it can be kind of difficult to transition from the theoretical proofs and research to application (or whatever you guys do.... he explains it to me and my eyes glaze over...).  That being said, his mastery of math makes me think it could be incredibly universal to the point it's just about picking a direction and spending some time focusing there (like you did) before trying to directly get into the industry.  An important thing, I've noticed, is a lot of the time people don't recognize the breadth of experience that comes with a PhD a lot of the time.  Like, knowing a bunch of about your dissertation topic is kinda a small part of everything else you are doing.  It's kinda frustrating, because I gained a ton of non-science specific skills that are pretty universal in application, but the focus is on the topic.  \n\nBasically, having a PhD is a blessing and a curse in terms of employment opportunities.  It also sucks with academia being so impacted, that the transition to industry can be funky with topics and skills."
