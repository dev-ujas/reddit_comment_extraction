You'll have to add `--network host` when runing the container so the ports will be opened to the outside world.\n\nI've also had trouble if you're running jupyterhub over a proxy.  You'll have to add someway to allow for certain ports to be open for D-Tale processes.  I did a big re-write a while back so that there is a little bit of predictability to how the ports are chosen for D-Tale.  Now it starts at 40000 and then keep incrementing until it finds an open one.  So you could update your proxy to allow for port 4000 to be open for D-Tale processes and then just keep killing the previous D-Tale instance if you open a new notebook and create a new instance.  If you just keep calling `dtale.show` within one notebook it will be fine becuase it only opens one instance and adds more data globally available to it.\n\nThe urls to your D-Tale instances should be sharable.  To access what the URL is you can do one of two things:\n\n1) if you've stored your D-Tale instance in a variable you can do something like this:\n\n```\nd = [dtale.show](https://dtale.show)(df)\nprint(d._url) . # sent this link to others to view it\n```\n2) in the ipython cell that D-Tale is running there should be an option in the menu for \"Open Popup\".  This will open D-Tale in a new window which should have the url listed in the top and you can send that to others.\n\nHope this helps!",

There should be a way to allow python processes through.  You don't want to allow a specific port through (although if you go that route 40000 is the best choice) because if you run multiple notebooks each with a different D-Tale instance they will be on different ports.\n\nUnfortunately I mainly develop on linux so I don't hit these issues.
